This repository currently hosts a **Final Project** for the [**CMSC320**](https://cmsc320.github.io/) (Introduction to Data Science) class made by *Svetlana Semenova* and *Annabel Yang*. 

This is viewable through the **CMSC320_Final_Project.ipynb** file, or through the HTML version of the notebook hosted at [ayy05.github.io](https://ayy05.github.io).

The raw data used in the Final Project is available in **raw_data.zip** if you wish to reproduce the results.

This project is also related to another project for the HACS200 (Applied Cybersecurity Foundations II) class involving honeypots, which can be found [here](https://github.com/friendly-besties-incorporated/all-honeypot-code). This is where/how the data used here was collected.
